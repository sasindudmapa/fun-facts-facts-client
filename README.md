# Fun Facts

The MERN stack project consists of four subprojects, each serving different functionalities to create an interactive web application. The main goal of the project is to provide users with fun facts to read, allow them to upload and store personal URLs, and give the owner the ability to manage fun facts and uploaded URLs through a locally hosted React application.

This app consists of four parts. This is the part 1 of the Fun Facts Web App.

## Part 4:User-Facing React App (URL Upload Feature)

The fourth subproject is a user-facing React application that users interact with to read fun facts and upload their personal URLs. Users can access this web app, read the fun facts managed by the owner, and utilize the feature to store their URLs securely. Upon uploading their URLs, the information is sent to the second backend and stored in the corresponding database (Part 3).
